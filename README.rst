pachubexml-unity-csharp
=======================
This is a bare-bones library to help work with Pachube XML documents in C#.  It will specifically need to support Unity game development tool, though it won't depend on unity libraries.

It is very rough.  It's my first bit of C# or .NET, and I won't have much time to spend on it.

It is unsupported.  Contributions are most welcome.

Initial ideas and code from Paul Tondeur's blog post: http://www.paultondeur.com/2010/03/23/tutorial-loading-and-parsing-external-xml-and-json-files-with-unity-part-1-xml/

Current Features
